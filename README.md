# Home Assistant
[Home Assistant](https://home-assistant.io) configuration with home automations.

Featured on Example page from https://www.home-assistant.io/cookbook/

Home Assistant Version: 2022.9.7

# Overview
I utilize Home Assistant to bridge and automate all my home automation products.  It was quickly realized as I expanded beyond some smart bulbs and a Wink hub, that nothing integrated into a single system for control, automation, and communication.  Home Assistant originally was run on a Raspberry Pi 3 but I have since moved it to run as a docker container leveraging a Postgresql docker backend.  Those looking to start out with Home Assistant should leverage a Raspberry Pi 4 and hass.io image to get started very simply.

My configuration started from an early version of geekofweek's configuration. Much of the automation and config is pulled from examples in his configuration but customized for my family's needs.  Home Assistant has many example configurations to leverage and I have published my configuration to share or reference for others.

I have expanded my home automation practices to the ESPHome platform to allow power monitoring automations as well as added controls for my Biocube Salt Water Aquarium, Garage Door Controllers, and Power Metering.  I am also utilizing ZWaveJS2MQTT for zwave control.

## Automation Overview
Typical Automations in use include
- Turn on / off outside lights at sunset
- Turn on / off pantry light when door opens / closes
- Turn off lights after no activity / motion
- Alarm notifications when away from home
- Grouping of lights for use with Alexa for commands
- Perform actions based on people leaving home / arriving home
- Update location for user based on geolocation zones (Work, School, Church, Home)
- Enable holiday color lights on outside lights via scenes
- Turn on lights based on motion / ring front door and return to previous theme after
- Send notification and flash lights if water detected in basement
- Send notification and flash lights if water detected by washing machine / Kitchen Sink
- Cut power to washing machine if water detected by washing machine
- Send notification and flash lights if CO / Smoke detectors go off
- Send alert if power is lost at the house
- Enhance security system through extra sensors and motion reading
- Send alert if auxiliary / emergency heat is activated
- Send long term data to InfluxDB for Grafana configuration
- Use Lutron Pico Remotes to enable Hue Lights and other automations
- Use ESPHome device to energy monitor circuits in the house
- Use EPSHome device for Garage Door Open/Close and state sensors
- Monitor Fish Aquarium (Biocube) power usage
- Alert for aquarium problems (heater running long / pump not running) 
- Change Ecobee mode when fireplace running
